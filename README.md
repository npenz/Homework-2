# Homework-2
Give me a list of football coaches who have been a head coach at the same school for at least three years. Make sure your output includes:

•	A single name field that displays a coach's name in first-last format (i.e., John Smith).

•	The name, id and state of the school.

•	The number of contracts for the coach as head coach of that particular school that we have in our database.

•	The total amount of school pay, other pay and total pay earned by the coach during that time.

•	You will need to use the coach, coach_record, conference, contract, division, position, school, school_conference and sport tables in your query.

•	Average school pay, other pay and total pay earned by the coach during that time.
•	Sort your data by last name, then first name.

•	BONUS 1: The football conference and division for that school in 2015, if we have it. (Leave it blank if we don’t.)

•	BONUS 2: The most recent career record that we have for that coach in our database and the year of that record. (Leave it blank if there is no record.)

•	BONUS 3: See if you can figure out a way to add dollar signs and commas to the pay numbers given above. (Email me if you want a hint on what functions to use here.)
